## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Theming and Theme Switching with React and styled-components](https://css-tricks.com/theming-and-theme-switching-with-react-and-styled-components/) - I'm trying to find out a good way to handle themes in react using Styled Components. But in this case it didn't work. Cause this solution is for people who wanna code using javascript. In my case I'm using typescript. But it was a good try at least.
- [Theme with styled-components and Typescript](https://medium.com/rbi-tech/theme-with-styled-components-and-typescript-209244ec15a3) - In this case this solution worked a lot. I'm still trying to figure out how is the best way to organize the informations of Themes and I'm sure it would not be solved only in this project but It's a start.
- [CSS Grid: Simplificando layouts](https://www.alura.com.br/conteudo/css-grid-layout?gclid=CjwKCAjw092IBhAwEiwAxR1lRpxK48dADm0B6iPqVyda7e8B_T3QXO4gV3sR4CPZsoGKxS6h8ztCWBoCKBwQAvD_BwE) - I needed to remember how I could use "grid-template-areas" and this link helped me a lot with it.
- [How to get the width of the window in React.js](https://www.jsdiaries.com/how-to-get-the-width-of-the-window-in-react-js/): I used it to remember how could I create a useState that get the width of the window everytime it change. So this way I can change the image of the sections.
